# Virtual Machine Experiments ![Travis Buildstatus](https://travis-ci.org/WalasPrime/vm-experiments.svg)
Very simple Virtual Machines (custom architecture) written in many languages for benchmarking purpose. A small project made to help understand the practical side of simulating a real logical computer architecture (not a physical one, we don't simulate delays on the transistors).

## Building
This project uses SCons 2.5.0 as it's buildsystem (which requires Python 2.7). After cloning this repo just execute the `scons` command to build all the executables.
